Variable explanation for Jury Instructions
By Way of explaining FIRST_DEGREE_ASSULT.md (FDA)

Generally, square brackets -- [ ] -- signify variables.

1. When a square bracket is by itself, it signifies optional language. For example, on line 2 of the FDA instruction, the text that reads: "The defendant is [also] charged..." means that the final instruction can read "The defendant is also charged..." OR "The defendant is charged..."

2. When there are series of square brackets, it signifies alternatives. For example, on line 5 for the FDA instruction, the text that reads: "A firearm is a weapon that propels [a bullet] [shotgun pellets] [a missile] [a projectile] by gunpowder or a similar explosive." means that the final instruction can read "A firearm is a weapon that propels a bullet by gunpowder or a similar explosive" OR "A firearm is a weapon that propels shotgun pellets by gunpowder or a similar explosive" OR "A firearm is a weapon that propels a missile by gunpowder or a similar explosive" OR "A firearm is a weapon that propels a projectile by gunpowder or a similar explosive".

2 (2d example). This same kind of square bracket variables can be see on line 8. It reads - "(2) causes serious and permanent or serious and protracted [disfigurement] ["loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ"]." So that means EITHER "disfigurement" or "loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ".

** NOTE: The instruction ENDS on LINE 9. When you see NOTES ON USE or COMMENT - that is extra information that is NOT part of the instruction itself
